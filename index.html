    <h1>Boba Site</h1>
    <p>Boba are chewy, tapioca pearls, traditionally made from cassava root, that are a key ingredient in Taiwanese-style bubble tea. They have a gummy-like texture and are typically sweetened with brown sugar, giving them a dark caramel color. Boba pearls are served at the bottom of the drink, and the drink itself is a mixture of tea, milk, and sweeteners, enjoyed through a wide straw.
